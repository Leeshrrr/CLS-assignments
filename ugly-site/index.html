        Rainbow in NYC!!
    </div>

    <div class="text">
        After the downpour of <span class="a">rain and blustery winds</span> died down on Monday night, a <span class="c">double rainbow arched over New</span> York City's skyline, offering a brief moment of peace. It was a <span class="b">special moment for those who caught it from their windowsâ€”many of whom were taking part in the nightly 7pm applause for essential workers.</span>        It was the perfect marriage of gratitude and hope.
